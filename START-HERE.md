## 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know coding?**
A: Not for deployment! Just follow QUICK-START.md. For content updates, basic copy/paste is enough.

**Q: Can I use this on Webflow?**
A: No, this is React code. But deploying to Vercel is easier and FREE!

**Q: What if I break something?**
A: GitHub saves all versions. You can always revert. That's the beauty of version control!

**Q: The placeholder boxes look weird. Is this broken?**
A: Nope! They're intentional placeholders for your photos. See IMAGE-UPLOAD-GUIDE.md

**Q: Can I change the green color?**
A: Yes, but requires editing Tailwind classes. Best to keep it for now - it matches your sustainability theme!

**Q: How do I accept donations?**
